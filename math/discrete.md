statement is either true or false
atomic statement cannot be divided into smaller
molecular is set of atomic
sentence is neither true nor false
if sentence contains variable than can capture variable by quantifying over it or specify variable substitution
atomic to molecular via connectives
binary connectives are - if then, iff, and, or
unary connectives - not
^ -> and, conjunction
v - or, disjunction, inclusive or
-> - implication, conditional, if then
<-> - biconditional

~ - negation

# Implication 
P -> Q
P - hypothesis (antecedent)
Q - conclusion (consequent)
Q -> P is converse of P-> Q

not Q -> not P is contrapositive and equivalent to P -> Q, so P->Q <-> ~Q->~P 

if P->Q and contrapositive Q->P than biconditional P<->Q, or (P->Q) and (Q->P)   

# Solution hints

- sometimes analyzing contrapositive is easier
- can ask about converse during analysis

# Predicate 

Predicate - sentence with variable

## Qualifiers

E - existential qualifier, there there exists, there is

Ex (x<0>)

A - universal, for all, every 
Ax(x>0)

### Negation

~A x P(X) <-> E x ~P(x)

~E x P(X) <-> A x ~P(x)
