Find longest sequence of zeros in binary representation of an number that is surrounded by ones at both ends in (1..(2^31 - 1)).

Examples:
9 - 1001 -  2. 
529 is 1000010001 - one of length 4 and one of length 3.
20 is 10100 - 1. 
15 is 1111 - 0.
1041  - 10000010001 - 5 largest , but have 3

worst-case 
time complexity is O(log(N))
space complexity is O(1)
