/*
A binary tree is either an empty tree or a node (called the root) consisting of a single integer value and two further binary trees.

Its root contains the value 5, and the roots of its left and right subtrees have the values 8 and 9, respectively. 
The right subtrees of the nodes containing values 4 and 7, as well as the left and right subtrees of the nodes containing values 1, 2, 3 and 12, are empty trees.
A binary tree can be given using a pointer data structure with left atribute as tree, right as tree, value as integer. 
An empty tree is represented by an empty pointer (denoted by NULL, null, None, nil etc.). 
A non-empty tree is represented by a pointer to an object representing its root. 
The height of a binary tree is defined as the length of the longest possible path in the tree. 
In particular, a tree consisting of only one node has height 0 and, conventionally, an empty tree has height −1. 

A path in a binary tree is a non-empty sequence of nodes that one can traverse by following the pointers. 
The length of a path is the number of pointers it traverses. 
A path of length K is a sequence of nodes P[0], P[1], ..., P[K], such that node P[I + 1] is the root of the left or right subtree of P[I], for 0 ≤ I < K.
